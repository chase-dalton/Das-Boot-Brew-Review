                    What makes a beer enjoyable? Well for most people, it's if the beer tastes good or not. But from a brewing or sales perspective, that's not very helpful.
                    "This beer is good!" is incredibly subjective. There are many components that go into a beer. How much alcohol is in it? What type is it? Where 
                    was it brewed? What aroma notes are there? How bitter is it? What type of yeast was used? Does smell matter more than mouthfeel? Our analysis takes
                    these factors and more into account. By analyzing various data sources, we were able to determine what factors best predict beer enjoyment.
