# Das Boot Brew Review

## **Topic**
  - Our topic is about beer! We want to know what factors contribute to the best glass of beer.

## **Reason**
  - We chose our topic due to everyone loving beer!

## **Description of data source**

  - Our data source is 1.5 million reviews on beers, with the ratings of look, taste, mouthfeel, and smell. Other data sources we have include different breweries and their locations, and types of ingredients for beer.

## **Questions we hope to answer**

  - We want to know what goes into making the perfect beer? What has the highest weight for someone to like a beer based on factors such as look, taste, mouthfeel, alcohol content, bitterness, and smell?

## **Communication**

- Our group is communicating primarily through Discord and Slack.  We created a Google Drive folder to house shared files, and also a trello board to manage our project.

## **Machine Learning**

- We have done preliminary linear regression on beer review data to identify which attributes of a beer contribute most to the overall review score.  We also hope to gather beer recipes via a dataset or food/beer API and use that information to build a ML model to predict a beer's review score based on the variety of hops, yeast, etc. as well as the amounts of each individual ingredient.  That will allow us to propose an ideal "beer recipe" (perhaps per beer style) to a brewery.

## **Database**

- We have set up a database through AWS to house our cleaned datasets.
